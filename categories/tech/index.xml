This may not be an option, and instead we want to install it straight onto a drive.
The Arch Wiki provides a guide to &lt;a class="link" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_from_existing_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Install Arch Linux from existing Linux&lt;/a&gt;, but it took a while to get all pieces right.
Consider this post to aim for a more noob-friendly and handholding setup on how to &lt;em&gt;install Arch from Arch&lt;/em&gt;.

Until April 2025, my main computer still had Windows running, but I found that I hardly use it for anything but the browser and games.
Given the Steam Deck experience, I was confident to ditch Windows and continue playing on Linux from here on.
Especially as pretty much anything I play is on Steam.
However, in my setup with an Nvidia RTX 3070 and Sway (thus Wayland), heavy ghosting occurred on games like &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, and one I started most recently, &lt;em&gt;Arc: Raiders&lt;/em&gt;.
Overall, these problems seem to happen with games that are built in &lt;em&gt;Unreal Engine&lt;/em&gt;, as e.g. &lt;em&gt;RDR2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; work flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>iPhone Ethernet bridge on RaspberryPi with Ubuntu Server</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-iphone-ethernet-bridge-rpi-4-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-iphone-ethernet-bridge-rpi-4-ubuntu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This post covers how to tether your iPhone via USB to your RaspberryPi, and share the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s network on &lt;code&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt;.
Eventually, the RaspberryPi will be connected to a router via ethernet, making the router use the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s internet connection.
A RaspberryPi 4B is used, but this guide &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work on other models too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may wonder why this setup is needed.
Routing at least DNS traffic through the Pi with the &lt;a class="link" href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt; is a common use-case, but all traffic less so.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Arch and i3 - Hello, Sway! - Install Arch and Sway</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-arch-and-i3-hello-sway-install-arch-and-sway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-arch-and-i3-hello-sway-install-arch-and-sway/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to part one of the three-part series &amp;ldquo;Hello, Sway!&amp;rdquo;

&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while already, there has been no real reason for me to keep Windows.
The doubt started about two years ago, in January 2023, when I got myself a Steam Deck.
Although the purchase was mostly to emulate console and handheld games, of course the question was
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-can-it-run-crysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;But Can It Run Crysis?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
To my surprise, the games I tried performed incredibly well, almost all of them out of the box.
Thanks to ProtonDB, if there was a title that needed some extra configuration, it is usually there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ubuntu with WSL2 and i3 Window Manager GUI</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-ubuntu-gui-wsl2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-ubuntu-gui-wsl2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;i3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; native is probably best, but you may not get the choice to do so, in case your working machine is running Windows.
I looked through several guides how to set up Ubuntu with &lt;code&gt;i3&lt;/code&gt; on WSL2, but it took me several hours to get the setup I looked for because things did not work as expected.
Therefore I&amp;rsquo;m writing this guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installing-ubuntu-on-wsl2"&gt;Installing Ubuntu on WSL2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of tutorials and videos to do so.
I will refer to the very one that I used to set up the bare, GUIless minimum,

Though this post is not about the legion, I have to say it is an awesome laptop.
What this post is about is how to make Ubuntu with &lt;a class="link" href="https://i3wm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Plenty of tutorials exist on the web to create a bootable Ubuntu USB stick.

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since many years I am using JDownloader as the solution to download things on all my computers.
The problem with it is though that the files are not synchronized between them.
Thus I cannot access what I downloaded from any machine different from the original downloader.
This problem worsens even with the fact that once I am not at home, I cannot access the harddrives the multimedia is on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Create a blog using Jekyll and Docker</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-create-blog-using-jekyll-and-docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Apr 2021 20:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-create-blog-using-jekyll-and-docker/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="foreword"&gt;Foreword

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like Jekyll, as I don&amp;rsquo;t like frontend development.
One problem is though, that I currently only have Jekyll installed on one single machine.
So when I&amp;rsquo;m not at home but want to add a blog post, I would have to install Jekyll on the machine I&amp;rsquo;m travelling with.
Luckily there is Docker and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;envygeeks/jekyll-docker&lt;/a&gt; Jekyll Image.
As I&amp;rsquo;m adding blogposts very rarely, I do not need to have a full build and delivery pipeline for it (despite the fact that at the time of writing I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be able to create such).
A simple container to build the latest version of the site suits my needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Read Temperature &amp; Humidity with RaspberryPi 4 - Docker Setup</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-raspberry-pi-four-dht-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-raspberry-pi-four-dht-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I showed how to enable the Raspberry Pi 4 on Ubuntu Server to read out DHT11/DHT22 sensor data. But this is a very hacky solution. Moreover is the Raspberry Pi cluttered with some stuff, that we may need to configure differently for another setup or remove as a whole. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice coincidence that I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading &lt;a class="link" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/docker-in-action/9781617294761/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Docker in Action, Second Edition&lt;/a&gt; (Manning, 2019), so I wanted to build a docker image to read out the data. There are some images available for this already, but I still wanted to build my own light-weight image.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Read Temperature &amp; Humidity with RaspberryPi 4</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-raspberry-pi-four-dht/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-raspberry-pi-four-dht/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a RaspberryPi 4 and installed Ubuntu Server 20.04 64 Bit on it. There are many tutorials available how to read the temperature/humidity via Python, unfortunately none of them worked out of the box. It seems to be that they are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;either for Raspbian OS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;or for 32 Bit OSes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some searching I found a way from several sources to make it run. This is a horrible hacky workaround and I&amp;rsquo;d be very happy to see a better way and/or out-of-the-box solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
