They are more or less the same, but not exactly.

&gt;Movember vs No Shave November (tue.nl)&lt;/a&gt;
provides a more detailed view of their differences.
The idea is simple:
Do not spend your money on a barber for the whole of November, instead donate it to a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don't Let Your Mocks Mock You!</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-dont-let-your-mocks-mock-you/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-dont-let-your-mocks-mock-you/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a short one about a pattern that we can unfortunately too often observe when it comes to mocks.
Especially with databases, we see our &amp;ldquo;Repository&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Database Connection&amp;rdquo; mocked out in tests.
That is, for the sake of unhappy path testing.
However, more often than not we also see that these mocks are used for happy path testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a real danger where our &lt;em&gt;mocks are mocking&lt;/em&gt; us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Generics - Invariance, Covariance and Contravariance</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-generics-invariance-covariance-contravariance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-generics-invariance-covariance-contravariance/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I stated that I am currently reading &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Kotlin in Action&lt;/a&gt; (2017, Manning).
In chapter 9, the authors introduce generics in Kotlin.
My overall experience with generics in Java is good, but apparently that book taught me something completely new.
The concept of &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Covariance and Contravariance&lt;/a&gt; was something unknown to me.
This post, though categorized Kotlin, focuses more on the concepts in general, yet will demonstrate them in Kotlin.
I assume the reader has a basic understanding of generics and inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Teststubs with Kotlin Extensions</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-teststubs-with-kotlin-extensions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-teststubs-with-kotlin-extensions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The repository with the Kotlin code can be found on &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/MisterDerpie/kotlin-data-stubs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;github/MisterDerpie/kotlin-data-stubs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m having the great luck that our team started using Kotlin at work.
For that reason, I decided to learn Kotlin properly and started my journey with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Kotlin in Action&lt;/a&gt; (2017, Manning).
This is a bit outdated, considering that Kotlin 1.5 is the current release, but the vast majority of concepts are the same as for 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concept that fascinates me and I really see a lot of value in is &lt;a class="link" href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Extensions&lt;/a&gt;.
Especially for tests I find that concept very useful, because it enables us to provide test related logic to our classes without actually adding this in the real production code.
Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at how we can utilize extensions to create stubs of business classes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spring Boot with MongoDB</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-spring-boot-with-mongodb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-spring-boot-with-mongodb/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The sourcecode of this post is available on &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/MisterDerpie/spring-boot-with-mongodb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h2 id="foreword"&gt;Foreword
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a small application to store receipts I wanted to use &lt;a class="link" href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Spring Boot&lt;/a&gt; and NoSQL database &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;MongoDB&lt;/a&gt;.
As with many basic topics in the spring world, there is a &lt;a class="link" href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mongodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Getting Started guide&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class="link" href="https://spring.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;spring.io&lt;/a&gt;, with the specific title &amp;ldquo;Accessing Data with MongoDB&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this guide may suffice for a really straightforward start, it actually misses out two, from my point of view, essential questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
