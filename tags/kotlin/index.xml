In chapter 9, the authors introduce generics in Kotlin.
My overall experience with generics in Java is good, but apparently that book taught me something completely new.
The concept of &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Covariance and Contravariance&lt;/a> was something unknown to me.
This post, though categorized Kotlin, focuses more on the concepts in general, yet will demonstrate them in Kotlin.
I assume the reader has a basic understanding of generics and inheritance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Teststubs with Kotlin Extensions</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-teststubs-with-kotlin-extensions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-teststubs-with-kotlin-extensions/</guid><description>&lt;p>The repository with the Kotlin code can be found on &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/MisterDerpie/kotlin-data-stubs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>Currently I&amp;rsquo;m having the great luck that our team started using Kotlin at work.
For that reason, I decided to learn Kotlin properly and started my journey with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Kotlin in Action&lt;/a> (2017, Manning).
This is a bit outdated, considering that Kotlin 1.5 is the current release, but the vast majority of concepts are the same as for 1.0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One concept that fascinates me and I really see a lot of value in is &lt;a class="link" href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Extensions&lt;/a>.
Especially for tests I find that concept very useful, because it enables us to provide test related logic to our classes without actually adding this in the real production code.
Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at how we can utilize extensions to create stubs of business classes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
