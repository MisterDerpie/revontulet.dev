A list of bullet points on my computer is from somewhere mid-June, and I originally intended to title it &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;The Underappreciation of Fast Feedback Loops&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>.

&lt;p>The &lt;del>Matrix&lt;/del> &lt;em>AI&lt;/em> is everywhere.
It is all around us.
Even now, in this very room.
You can see it when you look &lt;del>out your window&lt;/del> &lt;em>something up on the internet&lt;/em> or when you turn on your &lt;del>television&lt;/del> &lt;em>washing machine&lt;/em>.
You can feel it when you go to &lt;del>work&lt;/del> &lt;em>do anything nowadays&lt;/em>&amp;hellip;
when you go to &lt;del>church&lt;/del> a &lt;em>search engine&lt;/em>&amp;hellip;
when you &lt;del>pay&lt;/del> &lt;em>fill out&lt;/em> your taxes.
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from &lt;del>the truth&lt;/del> &lt;em>meaningful content&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
