&lt;/h1>&lt;p>So &amp;hellip; what is this about?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>My name is Matthias DÃ¶pmann.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer, originally from Germany, nowadays located at the Arctic Circle in Finland.
There is no specific content for this blog.
At the time of writing, I host a couple of articles on &lt;a class="link" href="https://misterderpie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>MisterDerpie.com&lt;/a>, that I intend to migrate over to this blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were several reasons I stopped writing on the old blog.
The first is, that whilst living in Dublin and working for Amazon/Amazon Web Services, I was fairly occupied by work and rarely found motivation to follow up on these topics besides work.
Second, in 2022, the world at Amazon was still remote, so on top of that I spent a lot of time travelling.
Moreover, instead of reading computer science/software engineering books, I spent a good chunk studying languages (actual languages, not Programming Languages).
These days I&amp;rsquo;m taking courses in Finnish, so I am not sure how much time is left to actually dump content here, but let&amp;rsquo;s see!
Ultimately, the non-integration of the old blog with GitHub Actions or the like set the bar higher to publish contentent.
Although I dockerized the process of rendering the blog, uploading it to an FTP after the render was still too annoying (&amp;hellip; and yes, whilst I could have automated that, I didn&amp;rsquo;t).
Checking out a GitHub repository, write down some thought, and then just hit &lt;code>git commmit&lt;/code> and &lt;code>git push&lt;/code> is just a lot more convenient.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
