# Welcome to revontulet.dev!

So ... what is this about?

## Introduction

My name is Matthias DÃ¶pmann.
I'm a Software Engineer, originally from Germany, living at the arctic circle.
There is no specific content for this blog.
At the time of writing, I host a couple of articles on [MisterDerpie.com](https://misterderpie.com/), that I intend to migrate over to this blog.

There were several reasons I stopped writing on the old blog.
The first is, that whilst living in Dublin and working for Amazon/Amazon Web Services, I was fairly busy actually working.
Second, in 2022, the world at Amazon was still remote, so on top of that I spent a lot of time travelling.
Moreover, instead of reading computer science/software engineering books, I spent a good chunk studying languages.
These days I'm taking courses in Finnish, so I am not sure how much time is left to actually dump content here, but let's see!
Ultimately, the non-integration of the old blog with GitHub Actions or the like made it a bigger barrier to publish contentent.
Although I dockerized the process of rendering the blog, uploading it to an FTP after the render was still too annoying.
Checking out a GitHub repository, write down some thought, and then just hit `git commmit` and `git push` is just a lto more convenient.

Given the content of my last blog, my work has shifted a bit. Whilst I was working in Java & Kotlin mostly, since 2025, my main language at work is Go (and YAML, loads of YAML).

## About Revontulet

The reason to call this site "Revontulet" is that 
Revontulet ([Wikipedia](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revontulet)) is the Finnish word for Aurora ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora)).
I found that a unique enough name for a website, as well as coupling it close to where I am situated these days.
