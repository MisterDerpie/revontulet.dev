This may not be an option, and instead we want to install it straight onto a drive.
The Arch Wiki provides a guide to &lt;a class="link" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Install_Arch_Linux_from_existing_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Install Arch Linux from existing Linux&lt;/a&gt;, but it took a while to get all pieces right.
Consider this post to aim for a more noob-friendly and handholding setup on how to &lt;em&gt;install Arch from Arch&lt;/em&gt;.

They are more or less the same, but not exactly.

Until April 2025, my main computer still had Windows running, but I found that I hardly use it for anything but the browser and games.
Given the Steam Deck experience, I was confident to ditch Windows and continue playing on Linux from here on.
Especially as pretty much anything I play is on Steam.
However, in my setup with an Nvidia RTX 3070 and Sway (thus Wayland), heavy ghosting occurred on games like &lt;em&gt;Hogwarts Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, and one I started most recently, &lt;em&gt;Arc: Raiders&lt;/em&gt;.
Overall, these problems seem to happen with games that are built in &lt;em&gt;Unreal Engine&lt;/em&gt;, as e.g. &lt;em&gt;RDR2&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt; work flawlessly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don't Let Your Mocks Mock You!</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-dont-let-your-mocks-mock-you/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-dont-let-your-mocks-mock-you/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a short one about a pattern that we can unfortunately too often observe when it comes to mocks.
Especially with databases, we see our &amp;ldquo;Repository&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Database Connection&amp;rdquo; mocked out in tests.
That is, for the sake of unhappy path testing.
However, more often than not we also see that these mocks are used for happy path testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a real danger where our &lt;em&gt;mocks are mocking&lt;/em&gt; us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Hidden Cost of Slow Feedback Loops</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-hidden-cost-slow-feedback-loops/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-hidden-cost-slow-feedback-loops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This post has been lying around as an idea for a couple of months now.
A list of bullet points on my computer is from somewhere mid-June, and I originally intended to title it &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Underappreciation of Fast Feedback Loops&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.
However, calling out a cost sounds catchier and is more accurate, because we do not only underappreciate them, but they cost us.
First and foremost, nerves (because who likes to wait for results?), but moreover do slow feedback loops actively reduce delivery speed of teams.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI-first - We're just 6 months away from AGI ;-)</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-ai-first/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-ai-first/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;del&gt;Matrix&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;AI&lt;/em&gt; is everywhere.
It is all around us.
Even now, in this very room.
You can see it when you look &lt;del&gt;out your window&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;something up on the internet&lt;/em&gt; or when you turn on your &lt;del&gt;television&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;washing machine&lt;/em&gt;.
You can feel it when you go to &lt;del&gt;work&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;do anything nowadays&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;
when you go to &lt;del&gt;church&lt;/del&gt; a &lt;em&gt;search engine&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;
when you &lt;del&gt;pay&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;fill out&lt;/em&gt; your taxes.

Eventually, the RaspberryPi will be connected to a router via ethernet, making the router use the iPhone&amp;rsquo;s internet connection.
A RaspberryPi 4B is used, but this guide &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; work on other models too.&lt;/p&gt;

Routing at least DNS traffic through the Pi with the &lt;a class="link" href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt; is a common use-case, but all traffic less so.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Arch and i3 - Hello, Sway! - Install Arch and Sway</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-arch-and-i3-hello-sway-install-arch-and-sway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-arch-and-i3-hello-sway-install-arch-and-sway/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to part one of the three-part series &amp;ldquo;Hello, Sway!&amp;rdquo;

&lt;h2 id="motivation"&gt;Motivation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a while already, there has been no real reason for me to keep Windows.
The doubt started about two years ago, in January 2023, when I got myself a Steam Deck.
Although the purchase was mostly to emulate console and handheld games, of course the question was
&amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-can-it-run-crysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;But Can It Run Crysis?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;
To my surprise, the games I tried performed incredibly well, almost all of them out of the box.
Thanks to ProtonDB, if there was a title that needed some extra configuration, it is usually there.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://revontulet.dev/p/2025-hello-world/cover-min.png" alt="Featured image of post Hello World" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="welcome-to-revontuletdev"&gt;Welcome to revontulet.dev!
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &amp;hellip; what is this about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Matthias Döpmann.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer, originally from Germany, nowadays located at the Arctic Circle in Finland.
There is no specific content for this blog.
At the time of writing, I host a couple of articles on &lt;a class="link" href="https://misterderpie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;MisterDerpie.com&lt;/a&gt;, that I intend to migrate over to this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several reasons I stopped writing on the old blog.
The first is, that whilst living in Dublin and working for Amazon/Amazon Web Services, I was fairly occupied by work and rarely found motivation to follow up on these topics besides work.
Second, in 2022, the world at Amazon was still remote, so on top of that I spent a lot of time travelling.
Moreover, instead of reading computer science/software engineering books, I spent a good chunk studying languages (actual languages, not Programming Languages).
These days I&amp;rsquo;m taking courses in Finnish, so I am not sure how much time is left to actually dump content here, but let&amp;rsquo;s see!
Ultimately, the non-integration of the old blog with GitHub Actions or the like set the bar higher to publish contentent.
Although I dockerized the process of rendering the blog, uploading it to an FTP after the render was still too annoying (&amp;hellip; and yes, whilst I could have automated that, I didn&amp;rsquo;t).
Checking out a GitHub repository, write down some thought, and then just hit &lt;code&gt;git commmit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; is just a lot more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ubuntu with WSL2 and i3 Window Manager GUI</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-ubuntu-gui-wsl2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-ubuntu-gui-wsl2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;i3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; native is probably best, but you may not get the choice to do so, in case your working machine is running Windows.
I looked through several guides how to set up Ubuntu with &lt;code&gt;i3&lt;/code&gt; on WSL2, but it took me several hours to get the setup I looked for because things did not work as expected.
Therefore I&amp;rsquo;m writing this guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installing-ubuntu-on-wsl2"&gt;Installing Ubuntu on WSL2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of tutorials and videos to do so.
I will refer to the very one that I used to set up the bare, GUIless minimum,

Though this post is not about the legion, I have to say it is an awesome laptop.
What this post is about is how to make Ubuntu with &lt;a class="link" href="https://i3wm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;i3wm&lt;/a&gt; run on the Lenovo Legion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need a USB stick as well as a Ubuntu ISO image.
Plenty of tutorials exist on the web to create a bootable Ubuntu USB stick.

&gt;Kotlin in Action&lt;/a&gt; (2017, Manning).
In chapter 9, the authors introduce generics in Kotlin.
My overall experience with generics in Java is good, but apparently that book taught me something completely new.
The concept of &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Covariance and Contravariance&lt;/a&gt; was something unknown to me.
This post, though categorized Kotlin, focuses more on the concepts in general, yet will demonstrate them in Kotlin.
I assume the reader has a basic understanding of generics and inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Teststubs with Kotlin Extensions</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-teststubs-with-kotlin-extensions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-teststubs-with-kotlin-extensions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The repository with the Kotlin code can be found on &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/MisterDerpie/kotlin-data-stubs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;github/MisterDerpie/kotlin-data-stubs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m having the great luck that our team started using Kotlin at work.
For that reason, I decided to learn Kotlin properly and started my journey with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Kotlin in Action&lt;/a&gt; (2017, Manning).
This is a bit outdated, considering that Kotlin 1.5 is the current release, but the vast majority of concepts are the same as for 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concept that fascinates me and I really see a lot of value in is &lt;a class="link" href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Extensions&lt;/a&gt;.
Especially for tests I find that concept very useful, because it enables us to provide test related logic to our classes without actually adding this in the real production code.
Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at how we can utilize extensions to create stubs of business classes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spring Boot with MongoDB</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-spring-boot-with-mongodb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-spring-boot-with-mongodb/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The sourcecode of this post is available on &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/MisterDerpie/spring-boot-with-mongodb" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really like Jekyll, as I don&amp;rsquo;t like frontend development.
One problem is though, that I currently only have Jekyll installed on one single machine.
So when I&amp;rsquo;m not at home but want to add a blog post, I would have to install Jekyll on the machine I&amp;rsquo;m travelling with.
Luckily there is Docker and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/envygeeks/jekyll-docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;envygeeks/jekyll-docker&lt;/a&gt; Jekyll Image.
As I&amp;rsquo;m adding blogposts very rarely, I do not need to have a full build and delivery pipeline for it (despite the fact that at the time of writing I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even be able to create such).
A simple container to build the latest version of the site suits my needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Read Temperature &amp; Humidity with RaspberryPi 4 - Docker Setup</title><link>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-raspberry-pi-four-dht-docker/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://revontulet.dev/p/2021-raspberry-pi-four-dht-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I showed how to enable the Raspberry Pi 4 on Ubuntu Server to read out DHT11/DHT22 sensor data. But this is a very hacky solution. Moreover is the Raspberry Pi cluttered with some stuff, that we may need to configure differently for another setup or remove as a whole.
